["Lieutenant Joshi: Officer K-D-six-dash-three-dot-seven, let's begin. Ready?","'K': Recite your baseline.","'K': And blood-black nothingness began to spin... A system of cells interlinked within cells interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem... And dreadfully distinct against the dark, a tall white fountain played.","Luv: I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.","'K': He named you. You must be special.","Lieutenant Joshi: Do you have any memories from before?","'K': I have memories, but... They're not real, they're just implants.","Lieutenant Joshi: Tell me one, from when you were a kid.","'K': I feel a little strange sharing a childhood story considering I was never a child.","Joi: Mere data makes a man. A and C and T and G. The alphabet of you. All from four symbols. I am only two: 1 and 0.","'K': Half as much but twice as elegant, sweetheart.","Joi: I'm done with you. You can go now.","Mariette: Quiet, now. I've been inside you. Not so much there as you think.","Rick Deckard: You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? Would you boy?","'K': Treasure Island?","Rick Deckard: He reads, that's good. Me too, not much else to do around here at night anymore. Many is the night I dream of cheese. Toasted, mostly. What Are You Doing Here?","'K': I heard the piano.","Rick Deckard: Don't lie, it's rude. You're a cop.","Rick Deckard: I had your job once. I was good at it.","'K': Things were simpler then."]
